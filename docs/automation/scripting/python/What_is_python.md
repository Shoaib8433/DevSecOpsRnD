# What is Python?

Python is a very popular general-purpose, platform independent interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected programming language.

- General-Purpose:
meaning it is designed to be versatile and applicable to a wide range of tasks and domains. It is not specialized for a specific type of application but can be used for various purposes.

- Platform Independent: 
When the O.S allocates same memory space to your same DataType in another O.S then it is said platform dependent.eg: INT takes 2bytes for one o.s and 2bytes for another o.s

- Interpreted:
source code is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime. This is in contrast to compiled languages where the code is translated into machine code before execution.

- Object-Oriented:
code is organized around objects, which are instances of classes. This paradigm promotes modularity, reusability, and a clear organization of code.

- High-Level:
High-level languages provide abstractions that make it easier for programmers to write code, reducing the complexity associated with low-level details. Python's syntax is designed to be readable and expressive.
Highlevel(Human Readable)

- Dynamically-Typed:
Type of a variable is determined at runtime. In dynamically-typed languages, you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly; the interpreter infers it as the program runs. 

- Garbage-Collected:
Python has automatic memory management through a garbage collector. The garbage collector is responsible for automatically identifying and reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by the program. 

# What is compiler and interpreter?

Both Compiler and Interpreters are program that converts the Source Code(HLL) into Machine Code(Low Level Lang).

## Compiler
- Compiler takes the entire program in one go
- Compiler generates an intermmediate Object Code
- Compiler converts High level program that can be executed many times
- High Memory Required
- Errors are displayed after entire code is checked

## Interpreter 
-   Interpreter takes a single code at a time
-   Interpreter never produces any intermediate code object.
-   Interpreter coverts high level program each time it is executed
-   Errors are displayed line by line
-   less memory required
